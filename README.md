# Super-sod theme

Based on [Simple theme](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/simple/styles/light).

You should use themekit to upload and download theme changes. You can read themekit's instructions [here](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/).


## Suggested workflow

Create a config.yml similar to the config-example.yml file included here. Remember to create access for the app, you can see how [here](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/#get-api-access). If you can't create the access, you can ask the store owner to do it.

Use the `master` tree to keep the live theme and create a branch when you are developing some feature.

Try to regularly download the live theme to keep the repository updated with live changes.
